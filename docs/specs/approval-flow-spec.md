# Approval Flow Feature Specification

> **Navigation**: [Home](../README.md) > [Approval Flow](../dev/approval-flow.md) > Feature Specification

This document defines the requirements and user stories for the Approval Flow feature in Backstage Software Templates.

## Overview

The Approval Flow feature enables governance in the software template scaffolding process by adding approval steps that pause execution until designated approvers review and authorize the requested actions.

## Requirements

The approval flow feature must:

1. **Pause Execution**: Allow templates to pause execution awaiting approval
2. **Support Multiple Approvers**: Enable defining individual users and groups as approvers
3. **Configurable Thresholds**: Support minimum approval counts (e.g., 2 of 5 approvers)
4. **Automatic Timeouts**: Allow setting time limits after which requests expire
5. **Decision Responses**: Support approval, rejection, and requesting changes
6. **Context Sharing**: Provide approvers with full context of what's being approved
7. **Integration Points**: Allow integration with external approval systems
8. **Notification System**: Notify approvers of pending requests
9. **Status Tracking**: Show approval status to template users
10. **Audit Trail**: Track all approval decisions for compliance

## User Stories

### For Template Users

| ID | Story | Priority | Status |
|----|-------|----------|--------|
| **US-T1** | As a template user, I want to see the approval status of my template execution so I know when action is needed | High | Planned |
| **US-T2** | As a template user, I want to be notified when my template is approved or rejected so I can take next steps | Medium | Planned |
| **US-T3** | As a template user, I want to provide additional information when requested by approvers so I can facilitate approval | Medium | Planned |
| **US-T4** | As a template user, I want to understand why my template was rejected so I can make necessary adjustments | High | Planned |

### For Template Approvers

| ID | Story | Priority | Status |
|----|-------|----------|--------|
| **US-A1** | As an approver, I want to receive notifications about pending approvals so I can review them promptly | High | Planned |
| **US-A2** | As an approver, I want to see all template parameters and context so I can make informed decisions | High | Planned |
| **US-A3** | As an approver, I want to approve or reject requests with comments to explain my decision | High | Planned |
| **US-A4** | As an approver, I want to request additional information before making a decision | Medium | Planned |
| **US-A5** | As an approver, I want to see which other approvers have already reviewed the request | Low | Planned |

### For Administrators

| ID | Story | Priority | Status |
|----|-------|----------|--------|
| **US-AD1** | As an admin, I want to configure approval workflows for templates so I can enforce governance | High | Planned |
| **US-AD2** | As an admin, I want to define who can approve specific types of templates so I can ensure proper authorization | High | Planned |
| **US-AD3** | As an admin, I want to set up timeout policies so requests don't remain pending indefinitely | Medium | Planned |
| **US-AD4** | As an admin, I want to integrate approvals with external systems so I can maintain consistent governance processes | Medium | Planned |

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Needs to integrate with existing template execution workflows
- Should support asynchronous processing
- Must handle user sessions and authentication for approvers
- Requires persistent storage for approval state

### Dependencies
- Authentication and authorization providers
- Notification system
- Template execution engine

## Success Metrics
- 90% of approval requests processed within SLA
- Reduction in unauthorized service creations
- Positive feedback from compliance teams
